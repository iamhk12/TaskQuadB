# ReactJS Application: TV Show Explorer

This is a ReactJS application that allows users to explore TV shows using the TV Maze API. It provides a simple and intuitive user interface with two screens. The first screen displays a list of TV shows along with some details, and the second screen shows the summary of a selected show. Additionally, the second screen allows users to book a movie ticket for the selected show.
